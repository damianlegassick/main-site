# Commented list of openLilyLib Packages

The following alphabetical list presents all packages that are officially
available from *openLilyLib's*
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/openlilylib), along with short
summaries of the package's purpose.

package, so you may equally have your own custom packages, or packages developed
by third parties, both of which are of course not listed here.
