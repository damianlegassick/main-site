# openLilyLib

*openLilyLib* is an extension infrastructure for the
[GNU LilyPond](https://lilypond.org) notation software. It is a mechanism
to capture blocks of functionality created by users and make them available as
powerful yet easy-to-use packages.

As a side effect the infrastructure provides many building blocks itself that
can be reused to simplify the development of custom extension functionality.
