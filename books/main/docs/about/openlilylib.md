# openLilyLib

*openLilyLib* is an extension infrastructure for the
[GNU LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) notation software. It provides a mechanism
to load external packages extending LilyPond's functionality, but this is
actually somewhat misleading as it simplifies the reality.

*openLilyLib* actually serves a two-fold goal: providing ready-to-use
functionality enhancements for LilyPond (bundled in packages) &ndash; and an
infrastructure providing building blocks to make it easier to create modular and
reusable bits of code and functionality in the end-user domain.
