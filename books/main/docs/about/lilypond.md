# GNU LilyPond

[GNU LilyPond](https://lilypond.org) is a music notation program strongly
inspired by traditional craftsmanship.

LilyPond works by compiling input files with a textual representation of musical
*content* into graphical score files. This is very different from the
WYSIWYG[^1] approach used by graphical applications that build upon the metaphor
of drawing on a sheet of paper.

The text based approach has advantages and offers potentials too numerous to be
detailed here[^2]. However, one of the more peculiar implications of it is the
nearly limitless extensibility; LilyPond can be “programmed” in the
document/user domain to an extent that is unimaginable with “plugins” as known
to common notation programs. Many power users have created &ndash; and shared
&ndash; incredible solutions to any conceivable notation challenge.

But how can we reuse the results, how can we avoid reinventing the wheel each
time anew, while making the created functionality available to other, less
programmatically inclined, users?

Enter *openLilyLib* ...
