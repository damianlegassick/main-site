# Participate!

Although originally started as a single-developer effort *openLilyLib* has
become a community project, and we are always in need of participation &ndash;
which can be in arbitrary ways.

## Use!

It may sound silly, but the most obvious way of supporting *openLilyLib* is
*using* it. More users mean more field testing, more visibility, and
consequently more potential developers. In its current form *openLilyLib* is
still a project and environment with rough edges and much polishing and
stabilization to be done.

## Test and Report!

Rough edges can only be polished after detection and discussion. If you are
experiencing problems don't try to silently get over them, adapt your code or
eventually decide to drop the tool, please report any problems, so they can be
made fruitful for improving the toolkit.

Please also go forward trying out new features or even challenge package
developers to enhance their packages.

## Contribute!

Of course the form of involvement we would be most happy about is actual development. [Contribute](../contribute/index.md) will give you pointers to general and specific resources you'll need for that.

### Fix!

If you are able to do so, or have learned something during discussion please
consider and don't hesitate engaging in a package's code base. Most package
maintainers if not all are more than happy receiving Pull Requests. [Package Development](../contribute/packages.md) introduces you to some general concepts you need for working on *openLilyLib* packages.

### Improve the Core!

Working on the core of openLilyLib is typically more involved than fixing or extending individual packages. But still it's not out of reach for everyone, so please consider giving it some thought. Don't dimiss the fact that this will also give you some influence over the direction this project is taking!
More information is on [Core Development](../contribute/core-development.md).

### Document!

If you are eager helping *openLilyLib* development but are afraid your coding
skills are not up to the task, then *please* consider joining our effort to
produce decent documentation. One of the main reasons (if not *the* main) that
*openLilyLib* still is sort of a niche product is its dramatic
under-documentation. More information can be found on
[Documentation](../contribute/documentation.md).
