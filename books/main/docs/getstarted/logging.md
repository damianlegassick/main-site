# Logging

*openLilyLib* provides some support of logging, notifying the user of problems related to their use of *openLilyLib* packages.[^notyet]

## *openLilyLib* Log Files

Whenever *openLilyLib* is loaded in a document being compiled, a log file `<file-basename>.oll.log` is written and populated with all log messages generated by *openLilyLib*.

## Log Levels

*openLilyLib* includes logging messages for four log levels: “debug”, “log”,
“warning”, and “critical”. Users can specify a threshold for which messages are
displayed in the console and written to the log file, the default being “log”.
This log level can be set with

```lilypond
\setLogLevel critical
```

to show only, say, “critical” messages.

In addition to the four message levels there is the state

```lilypond
\setLogLevel nolog
```

to indicate that no messages at all should be shown from *openLilyLib*.

[^notyet]:

    It has to be said that not all *openLilyLib* packages consequently make use
    of this functionality. If you find evidence of this we'd be grateful if you
    could gently remind the package authors to update their packages
    accordingly.
