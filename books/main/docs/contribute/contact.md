# Get in Touch

We are happy to hear from users, ideally of course success stories ;-) But other
users and maintainers of *openLilyLib* and its packages are happy to help with
any issues that may arise with using the infrastructure or specific packages. In
any case we prefer users we know over anonymous ones.

Depending on the type of question there are several communications channels
available.

## Problems and (Possible) Bugs

In case of concrete problems with specific packages that look like possible bugs
each package has its own issue tracker in its GitHub repository. This is the
best place to report crashes or other strange behaviour, however, it should be
clear that reported issues will not be read by many by default.

## General Questions and Discussion

Clearly the best way to get in touch with *openLilyLib*, i.e. other users and
developers, is the
[lilypond-user](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user) mailing
list. Any *openLilyLib* user is by definition a *LilyPond* user as well, and
since it usually isn't clear on first sight whether problems arise from a bug in
a specific package, faulty user input with regard to the *openLilyLib* package,
faulty general input, or even a LilyPond bug.

Therefore it is usually the best approach to raise any issues on the
`lilypond-user` list and collectively decide what to do with them.

## Private Contact

It is also possible to directly contact a human by email. Packages should have
their maintainers listed in a file `package.cnf` in the root directory of the
package, some also list maintainers in the `README.md` file that is visible on
the package's GitHub entry page.

Finally the email address `info at openlilylib dot org` will also address a
maintainer.

However, in general any form of *public* communication is preferable, if no
specific reasons suggest otherwise.
