# Writing Documentation

The website you are reading now has been started in February 2020 as a first
shot at a coherent and comprehensive documentation strategy for *openLilyLib*.
It features high-level “authored” manuals that can pretty easily be maintained
without touching internal package code. In addition to that we are working an a
solution to also integrate API/code documentation with a low-level reference of
available commands and functionality.

While typically package authors are experts on how their code works they are not
necessarily the best-equipped to *explain* the broader concepts and usage. So
writing documentation for others' packages is something many people can help out
with who might otherwise feel not qualified to get involved. Please go forward,
get in touch with us or specific package authors and dive right in. One possible
side-effect is that often such discussions result in additional ideas and new
functionality being implemented.

The following pages will tell you what you need to set up to being able to contribute writing documentation.
