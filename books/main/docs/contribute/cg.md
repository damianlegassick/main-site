# Contributor's Guide

The *openLilyLib* Contributor's Guide is a rather substantial document and
therefore hosted separately at <https://cg.openlilylib.org>.

At this point (see file date at the bottom of the page) there is no proper
content available. Please let yourself not be discouraged by the lack of a CG.
Rather, get in touch with us, and while getting you up to speed we can work on
the documentation.

The CG will include the mechanisms of creating, maintaining and publishing
*openLilyLib* packages, as well as writing and creating documentation.
