# Contributor's Guide

An *openLilyLib* Contributor's Guide is not available at this point. Since it
will be a rather substantial document it will not be integrated in this part of
the website but hosted separately.

Please let yourself not be discouraged by the lack of a CG. Rather, get in touch
with us, and while getting you up to speed we can work on the documentation.

The CG will include the mechanisms of creating, maintaining and publishing
*openLilyLib* packages, as well as writing and creating documentation.
